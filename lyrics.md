# Your Love Awakens Me

There were walls between us  
By the cross you came  
And broke them down  
You broke them down  
  
There were chains around us  
By your grace we are  
No longer bound  
No longer bound  
  
You called me out of the grave  
You called me into the light  
You called my name and then my heart came alive  
  
Your love is greater  
Your love is stronger  
Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me  
Your love is greater  
Your love is stronger  
Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me  
  
Feel the darkness shaking  
All the dead are coming  
Back to life  
Back to life  
  
Hear the song awaken  
All creation singing  
We're alive  
Cause You're alive  
  
You called me out of the grave  
You called me into the light  
You called my name and then my heart came alive  
  
Your love is greater  
Your love is stronger  
Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me  
Your love is greater  
Your love is stronger  
Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me  
  
And what a love we found  
Death can't hold us down  
We shout it out  
We're alive  
Cause you're alive  
  
# God of Wonders  
  
Lord of all creation  
Of the water, earth and sky  
The Heavens are Your Tabernacle  
Glory to the Lord on high  
  
God of wonders, beyond our galaxy  
You are holy, holy  
The universe declares Your majesty  
You are holy, holy  
Lord of heaven and earth  
  
Early in the morning  
I will celebrate the light  
And as I stumble into darkness  
I will call Your name by night  
  
God of wonders, beyond our galaxy  
You are holy, holy  
The universe declares Your majesty  
You are holy, holy  
Lord of heaven and earth  
  
Hallelujah to the Lord of Heaven and earth  
Hallelujah to the Lord of Heaven and earth  
Hallelujah to the Lord of Heaven and earth  

# Jesus Paid it All

I hear the Savior say  
Thy srength indeed is small  
Child of weakness watch and pray  
Find in me thine all in all  

Jesus paid it all  
All to Him I owe  
Sin had left a crimson stain  
He washed it white as snow  

Lord now indeed I find  
Thy power and thine alone  
Can change the leper's spots    
And melt the heart of stone  

Jesus paid it all  
All to Him I owe  
Sin had left a crimson stain  
He washed it white as snow  

And when before the throne  
I stand in Him complete  
Jesus died my soul to save  
My lips shall still repeat  

Jesus paid it all  
All to Him I owe  
Sin had left a crimson stain  
He washed it white as snow  

Oh praise the one who paid my debt  
And raised this life up from the dead  

# How Deep the Father's Love

How deep the Fatherâ€™s love for us  
How vast beyond all measure  
That He should give His only Son  
To make a wretch His treasure  
  
How great the pain of searing loss  
The Father turns His face away  
As wounds which mar the Chosen One  
Bring many sons to glory  
  
Behold the man upon a cross  
My sin upon His shoulders  
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice  
Call out among the scoffers  
  
It was my sin that held Him there  
Until it was accomplished  
His dying breath has brought me life  
I know that it is finished  
  
I will not boast in anything  
No gifts, no power, no wisdom  
But I will boast in Jesus Christ  
His death and resurrection  
  
Why should I gain from His reward  
I cannot give an answer  
But this I know with all my heart  
His wounds have paid my ransom  

# Nothing but the Blood

What can wash away my sin  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
What can make me whole again  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
Oh, precious is the flow  
That makes me white as snow  
No other fount I know  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  

# Great Are You Lord

You give life, You are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope, You restore
Every heart that is broken

Great are You Lord

It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
We pour out our praise
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise to You only

All the earth will shout Your praise
Our hearts will cry, these bones will sing
Great are You Lord

# Better is One Day

How lovely is Your dwelling place  
O Lord Almighty  
My soul longs and even faints for You  
For here my heart is satisfied  
Within Your presence  
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings  
  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Better is one day in Your house  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Than thousands elsewhere  
  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Better is one day in Your house  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Than thousands elsewhere  
  
One thing I ask, and I would seek  
To see Your beauty  
To find You in the place Your glory dwells  
Your glory dwells  
  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Better is one day in Your house  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Than thousands elsewhere
