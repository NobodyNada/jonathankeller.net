# Holy is the Lord

We stand and lift up our hands  
For the joy of the Lord is our strength  
We bow down and worship Him now  
How great, how awesome is He  
And together we sing  

Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory  

We stand and lift up our hands  
For the joy of the Lord is our strength  
We bow down and worship Him now  
How great, how awesome is He  
And together we sing  
And everyone sing  

Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory  

Yeah, it's rising up all around  
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown  
It's rising up all around  
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown  

Together we sing  
And everyone sing  

Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory  

# Fall Afresh

Awaken my soul, come awake  
To hunger, to seek, to thirst  
Awaken first love, come awake  
And do as You did, at first  

Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me  
Come wake me from my sleep  
Blow through the caverns of my soul  
Pour in me to overflow  
To overflow  

Spirit come and fill this place  
Let Your glory now invade  
Spirit come and fill this place  
Let Your glory now invade  

Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me  
Come wake me from my sleep  
Blow through the caverns of my soul  
Pour in me to overflow  

# Give us Clean Hands

We bow our hearts, we bend our knees  
Oh Spirit come make us humble  
We turn our eyes from evil things  
Oh Lord we cast down our idols  

So give us clean hands and give us pure hearts  
Let us not lift our souls to another  
Oh give us clean hands and give us pure hearts  
Let us not lift our souls to another  

Oh God let this be a generation that seeks  
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob  
Oh God let us be a generation that seeks  
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob  

We bow our hearts, we bend our knees  
Oh Spirit come make us humble  
We turn our eyes from evil things  
Oh Lord we cast down our idols  

So give us clean hands and give us pure hearts  
Let us not lift our souls to another  
Give us clean hands, oh God and give us pure hearts  
Let us not lift our souls to another  

Oh God let us be a generation that seeks  
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob  
Oh God let us be a generation that seeks  
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob  
Oh God of Jacob
