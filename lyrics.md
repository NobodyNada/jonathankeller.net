# Run To the Father  
  
### Verse 1  
I've carried a burden for too long on my own

And I know that I need You

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
  
### Verse 2  
You saw my condition, had a plan from the start  
Your Son for redemption, the price for my heart  
And I don't have a context for that kind of love  
I don't understand, I can't comprehend  
All I know is I need You  
  
### Chorus  
I run to the Father, I fall into grace  
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait  
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend

Oh-oh, oh-oh…  
Again and again and again and again (Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
Oh-oh, oh-oh… (Oh-ohh)  
  
### Bridge  
My heart has been in Your sights  
Long before my first breath  
Running into Your arms  
Is running to life from death  
And I feel this rush deep in my chest  
Your mercy is calling out  
Just as I am You pull me in  
And I know I need You now  
  
### Chorus  
I run to the Father, I fall into grace  
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait  
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend  
So I'll run to the Father again and again  
I run to the Father, I fall into grace  
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait  
And my heart found a surgeon, my soul found a friend  
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again  
Oh-oh, oh-oh…  
Again and again and again and again (Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Again and again
