# How Great Thou Art

Oh Lord, my God
When I, in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration
And then proclaim, my God, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

# At Your Name

At Your name, the mountains shake and crumble
At Your name, the oceans roar and tumble
At Your name, angels will bow
The earth will rejoice, Your people cry out

Lord of all the earth we shout Your name, shout Your name
Filling up the skies with endless praise, endless praise
Yahweh, Yahweh, we love to shout Your name, oh Lord

At Your name, the morning breaks in glory
At Your name, creation sings Your story
At Your name, angels will bow, 
The earth will rejoice, Your people cry out

Lord of all the earth we shout Your name, shout Your name
Filling up the skies with endless praise, endless praise
Yahweh, Yahweh, we love to shout Your name, oh Lord

There is no one like our God
We will praise You, praise You
There's no one like our God
We will sing, we will sing

Lord of all the earth we shout Your name, shout Your name
Filling up the skies with endless praise, endless praise
Yahweh, Yahweh, we love to shout Your name, oh Lord

# Your Love Is Strong

Heavenly Father, You always amaze me
Let Your kingdom come in my world and in my life
Give me the food I need to live through today
And forgive me as I forgive the people that wrong me

Lead me far from temptation
Deliver me from the evil one

I look out the window, the birds are composing
Not a note is out of tune or out of place
I walk to the meadow and stare at the flowers
Better dressed than any girl on her wedding day

So why should I worry?
Why do I freak out?
God knows what I need
You know what I need

Your love is, Your love is, Your love is strong
Your love is, Your love is, Your love is strong
Your love is, Your love is, Your love is strong

The Kingdom of the heavens is now advancing
Invade my heart, invade this broken town
The Kingdom of the heavens is buried treasure
Would you sell yourself to buy the one you've found?

The Kingdom of the heavens is now advancing
Invade my heart, invade this broken town
The Kingdom of the heavens is buried treasure
Would you sell yourself to buy the one you've found?

Your love is, Your love is, Your love is strong
Your love is, Your love is, Your love is strong
Your love is, Your love is, Your love is strong

Our God in heaven
Hallowed be Thy name above all names
Your kingdom come, Your will be done
On earth as it is in Heaven
Give us, today, our daily bread
Forgive us weary sinners
Keep us far from our vices and
Deliver us from these prisons

# All who are Thirsty

All who are thirsty, all who are weak
Come to the fountain, dip your heart in the stream of life
Let the pain and the sorrow be washed away
In the waves of his mercy as deep cries out to deep

Come Lord Jesus come 
Holy Spirit come 
As deep cries out to deep

# Come To the Water

Come to the waters  
See from our Lord a river flows
Drink of His mercy  
Draw from its depths and be made whole

You fill my soul with living water
Oh my God you satisfy me deep within
Your holy presence fills my soul
With living water  
With living water  

Come follow Jesus  
Know His great love and faithfulness
Trust in His goodness  
See that our Lord will give you rest

You fill my soul with living water
Oh my God you satisfy me deep within
Your holy presence fills my soul
With living water  
With living water  

Where Your spirit is there's freedom
Pour out your freedom
Pour out your freedom

You fill my soul with living water
Oh my God you satisfy me deep within
Your holy presence fills my soul
With living water  
With living water  

# Run To the Father

I've carried a burden for too long on my own
I wasn't created to bear it alone
I hear Your invitation to let it all go
I see it now, I'm laying it down
And I know that I need You

I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

You saw my condition, had a plan from the start
Your Son for redemption, the price for my heart
And I don't have a context for that kind of love
I don't understand, I can't comprehend
All I know is I need You

I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

My heart has been in Your sights long before my first breath
Running into Your arms is running to life from death
And I feel this rush deep in my chest, your mercy is calling out
Just as I am You pull me in and I know I need You now

I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again

I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
And my heart found a surgeon, my soul found a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

# Lead Me To the Cross

Savior I come quiet my soul
Remember redemption's hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my ransom

Everything I once held dear
I count it all as loss

Lead me to the cross where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself I belong to You
Oh lead me lead me to the cross

You were as I tempted and tried human
The word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now You're risen

Everything I once held dear
I count it all as loss

Lead me to the cross where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself I belong to You
Oh lead me lead me to the cross

To Your heart
To Your heart
Lead me to Your heart
Lead me to Your heart

Lead me to the cross where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself I belong to You
Oh lead me lead me to the cross
