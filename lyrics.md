# Holy is the Lord

We stand and lift up our hands  
For the joy of the Lord is our strength  
We bow down and worship Him now  
How great, how awesome is He  
And together we sing  

Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory  

We stand and lift up our hands  
For the joy of the Lord is our strength  
We bow down and worship Him now  
How great, how awesome is He  
And together we sing  
And everyone sing  

Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory  

Yeah, it's rising up all around  
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown  
It's rising up all around  
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown  

Together we sing  
And everyone sing  

Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty  
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory  

# Fall Afresh

Awaken my soul, come awake  
To hunger, to seek, to thirst  
Awaken first love, come awake  
And do as You did, at first  

Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me  
Come wake me from my sleep  
Blow through the caverns of my soul  
Pour in me to overflow  
To overflow  

Spirit come and fill this place  
Let Your glory now invade  
Spirit come and fill this place  
Let Your glory now invade  

Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me  
Come wake me from my sleep  
Blow through the caverns of my soul  
Pour in me to overflow  

# Give us Clean Hands

We bow our hearts, we bend our knees  
Oh Spirit come make us humble  
We turn our eyes from evil things  
Oh Lord we cast down our idols  

So give us clean hands and give us pure hearts  
Let us not lift our souls to another  
Oh give us clean hands and give us pure hearts  
Let us not lift our souls to another  

Oh God let this be a generation that seeks  
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob  
Oh God let us be a generation that seeks  
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob  

We bow our hearts, we bend our knees  
Oh Spirit come make us humble  
We turn our eyes from evil things  
Oh Lord we cast down our idols  

So give us clean hands and give us pure hearts  
Let us not lift our souls to another  
Give us clean hands, oh God and give us pure hearts  
Let us not lift our souls to another  

Oh God let us be a generation that seeks  
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob  
Oh God let us be a generation that seeks  
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob  
Oh God of Jacob

Worthy of every song we could ever sing  
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring  
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe  
We live for You, oh, we live for You  

Jesus, the Name above every other name  
Jesus, the only One who could ever save  
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe  
We live for You, we live for You

There is none beside You  
Open up my eyes in wonder  
And show me who You are  
And fill me with Your heart  
And lead me in Your love to those around me

# How Great is Our God 

The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty  
Let all the Earth rejoice  
All the Earth rejoice  

He wraps himself in light  
And darkness tries to hide  
And trembles at His voice  
Trembles at His voice  

How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God  

Age to age He stands  
And time is in His hands  
Beginning and the end  
Beginning and the end  

The Godhead Three in One  
Father Spirit Son  
The Lion and the Lamb  
The Lion and the Lamb  

How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God  

Name above all names  
Worthy of our praise  
My heart will sing  
How great is our God  

You're the name above all names  
You are worthy of our praise  
And my heart will sing  
How great is our God  

How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God  

# We Fall Down

We fall down  
We lay our crowns  
At the feet of Jesus  

The greatness of  
Mercy and love  
At the feet of Jesus  

And we cry holy, holy, holy  
We cry holy, holy, holy  
We cry holy, holy, holy  
Is the lamb  

# House of God Forever

God is my shepherd  
I won't be wanting, I won't be wanting  
He makes me rest  
In fields of green, with quiet streams  

Even though I walk  
Through the valley, of death and dying  
I will not fear  
'Cause You are with me, You are with me  

Your shepherd's staff comforts me  
You are my feast in the presence of enemies  
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me  
In the house of God forever  

# How he Loves

He is jealous for me.  
Love's like a hurricane. I am a tree,  
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.  
  
When all of a sudden,  
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory.  
And I realize just how beautiful You are,  
And how great Your affections are for me.  
  
And, oh, how He loves us, oh.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
How He loves us, oh.  
  
And He is jealous for me.  
Love's like a hurricane. I am a tree,  
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.  
  
When all of a sudden,  
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory.  
And I realize just how beautiful You are,  
And how great Your affections are for me.  
  
And, oh, how He loves us, oh.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
How He loves us, oh.  
  
Yeah, He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves.  
  
And we are His portion and He is our prize,  
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes.  
If His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.  
  
And Heaven meets earth like an sloppy wet kiss.  
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest.  
I don't have time to maintain these regrets,  
When I think about the way...  
  
That He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves.  
  
Yeah, He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves.  
  
Yeah, He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves us.  
Oh, how He loves.
